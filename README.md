# Groove Box Drum Machine
An Arduino Nano based drum machine based on the awesome Drum Kid (https://github.com/mattybrad/drumkid) by Matt Bradshaw.  My version includes 3 X trigger outs to sync with other synths.  I've designed it so it will fit into any Eurorack and can be powered by either a standard 16 pin Eurorack power input or a 9V JST connector.
I've also created an Instructable which you can find here - This is a step by step guide that makes it super simple to make your own.
