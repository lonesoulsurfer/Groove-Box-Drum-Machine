# Groove-Box-Drum-Machine
An Arduino Nano based drum machine based on the awesome Drum Kid by https://github.com/mattybrad/drumkid.  My version includes 3 X trigger out to sync with your other synths.  I've designed it so it will fit into any Eurorack and can be powered by either a standard 16 pin Eurorack power input or a 9V JST connector.
