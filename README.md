# Groove Box Drum Machine
An Arduino Nano based drum machine based on the awesome DrumKid build (https://github.com/mattybrad/drumkid) by Matt Bradshaw.  My version includes 3 X trigger outs so you can sync with other synths.  I've designed it so it will fit into any Eurorack and can be powered by either a standard 16 pin Eurorack power input or a 9V JST connector.

I've also created an Instructable which you can find here - This is a step by step guide that makes it super simple to build your own, especially if you are new to Arduino and modular synths.

Te main goal with building this module is to create a modular synth. I wanted to keep everything as simple as possble with each module built on the following aims:

 - Can be powered by 9V (and 12V)
 - Easy to build with minimum components
 - Use Arduino to keep it simple (plus it helps to keep the components down!
 - Can fit into any modular synth Eurorck (include the ability to power the module via normal module power sources
 - Has to sound great!

As mentioned above, the full build can be found on my Instructables page.
