# Groove Box Drum Machine
An Arduino Nano based drum machine based on the awesome DrumKid build (https://github.com/mattybrad/drumkid) by Matt Bradshaw.  My version includes 3 X trigger outputs so you can sync with other synths.  I've also designed it so it will fit into any Eurorack and can be powered by either a standard 16 pin Eurorack power input or a 9V JST connector.

You can find a step by step guide on my Instructables page on how to build your own.  

Te main goal with building this module is to create a modular synth. I wanted to keep everything as simple as possble with each module built on the following aims:

 - Can be powered by 9V (and 12V)
 - Easy to build with minimum components
 - Use Arduino to keep it simple (plus it helps to keep the components down!
 - Can fit into any modular synth Eurorck (include the ability to power the module via normal module power sources
 - Has to sound great!

As mentioned above, the full build can be found on my Instructables page.
